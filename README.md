## Overview 🌍
Global Tracking is a data visualization project that integrates SQL databases, Google Maps API, and Apache Superset to provide insightful geospatial analytics. The project visualizes location-based data using bubble charts and heatmaps, integrates an interactive dashboard, and is hosted on PythonAnywhere.

## Features ✨
- **Data Storage:** Loaded and managed data in an SQL database.
- **Google Maps Visualization:** Utilized Google Maps API to display data points with bubble charts and heatmaps.
- **Superset Dashboard:** Integrated Apache Superset for advanced data visualization.
- **Web Hosting:** Deployed the web application using PythonAnywhere.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **SQL Database** (for data storage and management)
